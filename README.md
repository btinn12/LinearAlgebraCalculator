# LinearAlgebraCalculator
This project will make common linear algebra problems very easy to solve using an intuitive html/css/javascript interface

Current Goals:
-Rework UI to better display more digits
-Make a system that will hold previous calculations in a history so they can be reused later
-Continue adding calculations (e.g. LU, QR, PDP^-1 factorizations, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, etc...)
